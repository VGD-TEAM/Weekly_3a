## Controls
| **Action**               | **Default Key**   |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Switch to Laser           | `1`              |

## How It Works
1. **Weapon Switching**:
   - Players can switch between Laser and Bomb weapons using `1` and `2` keys.
   - Each weapon has unique behaviors, such as precise laser targeting or explosive bomb attacks.

2. **Combo Mode**:
   - Enable combo mode using `Enter` to fire multiple lasers in a sequence.
   - Customize the number of lasers (`lasersInCombo`) and the delay (`delayBetweenLasers`) in Unity's Inspector.

3. **Shooting Mechanic**:
   - Press `Space` to shoot the active weapon.
   - The game spawns appropriate projectiles and calculates scores dynamically.

## Code Overview
The **LaserShooter** script inherits from `ClickSpawner` and manages:
- Weapon switching (Laser, Bomb).
- Combo mode functionality using coroutines.
- Score tracking with the `NumberField` component.
- Input handling with Unity's **Input System**.

### Key Methods:
- **SwitchToLaser()**: Activates the laser weapon.
- **SwitchToBomb()**: Activates the bomb weapon.
- **ToggleComboMode()**: Toggles combo mode on or off.
- **PerformShoot()**: Handles shooting based on the active weapon and combo state.
- **ShootCombo()**: Implements combo shooting using coroutines.

## Customization
### Inspector Settings:
- `pointsToAdd`: Points gained for hitting a target.
- `lasersInCombo`: Number of lasers fired in combo mode (default: 3).
- `delayBetweenLasers`: Delay between lasers in combo mode (default: 0.2 seconds).

### Input Bindings:
You can modify the input bindings in the script or the Unity **Input System** to suit your preferences.
